<!-- The changing web -------------------------------------------------------------------->
<!--data-background="images/DSC07942-201309.jpg"-->
<section data-transition="linear" data-transition-speed="medium">
  <section data-transition="linear" data-transition-speed="medium">
    <h2>The changing web</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The advent of AJAX marked a web shift</li>
      <li>As a result sites became more responsive</li>
      <li>And increasingly complex web applications were being built</li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="notes">
      <p>Before AJAX platforms like PHP, Python/Django and Ruby/Rails were used to help render web front-ends</p>

      <p>That worked great but required pages to be refreshed to see any data updates.</p>

      <p>By eliminating the need for full-page refreshes, AJAX marked an important shift in the development of the
        web.</p>

      <p>Web applications became more responsive and increasingly more ambitious applications were being built.</p>

      <p>Front-ends started relying less on backend servers as more application logic moved into the front-end.</p>

      <p>This benefitted the backend because rendering, logic and computation could be distributed to user machines
        allowing backends to more easily scale.
      </p>
    </aside>
  </section>

  <!-- Handling front-end complexity -------------------------------------------------------------------->
  <section data-transition="linear" data-transition-speed="medium">
    <h2>Handling front-end complexity</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Code moves into the front-end</li>
      <li>Developers face increased code complexity</li>
      <li>Enter: open-source front-end web frameworks with names like: Backbone, Ember, Knockout and
        Angular
      </li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="notes">
      <p>As code moved into the front-end and front-ends became richer, developers found they needed ways to handle the
        increased front-end code. They were forced to consider how large applications are built using software libraries
        and
        frameworks and bring some of that native and server goodness to front-end development.</p>

      <p>They begin developing open-source front-end web frameworks with names like: Backbone, Ember, Knockout and
        Angular.</p>

      <p>Today there are no lack of choices regarding framework. However, Angular has made a name for itself and many of
        the developers I meet are genuinely excited about it.</p>

  <!-- AngualrJS -------------------------------------------------------------------->
  <section data-transition="linear" data-transition-speed="medium">
    <h2>AngualrJS</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Angular is loosely similar to many of the other frameworks that emerged to address the increasing demands of
        modern web development
      </li>
      <li>However, the similarities quickly give way to an amazing array of cleanly integrated and forward thinking
        features
      </li>
      <li>We'll cover many of Angular's features in this presentation</li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="notes">
      <p>Frameworks like Backbone, Ember and Knockout are great for building single page web applications.</p>
      <p>However, as an application grows older frameworks require developers to do more work to keep their applications maintanable.</p>

<!-- Why AngularJS -------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<section data-transition="linear" data-transition-speed="medium">

  <section data-transition="linear" data-transition-speed="medium">
    <h2>Why AngularJS?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Embraces the spirit and potential of HTML5</li>
      <li>Offers features which are designed to work together</li>
      <li>Simplifies building modern web application</li>
      <li>When used correctly, it makes your code highly testable</li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="notes">
      <p>Angular stands apart from other frameworks in that it is first and foremost about unlocking the potential of
        HTML.</p>

      <p>Angular embraces HTML and extends it in ways which feel natural and uncontrived.</p>

      <p>In fact, starting Angular developers eventually realize that if HTML and the DOM were more evolved then there
        wouldn't be a need for AngularJS.</p>

      <p>Or AngularJS would be a lot different from what it is today. Perhaps, yet another MVC framework.</p>

  <!-- The original vision for Angular -------------------------------------------------------------------------->
  <section data-transition="linear" data-transition-speed="medium">
    <h2>The original vision</h2>

    <p>Originally, Angular was designed as a way of enabling designers to use HTML markup to build application without
      having to know how to program</p>
    <aside class="notes">
      <p>The originally goal for Angular was to provide a way for designers to use HTML markup to build application
        without
        having to know how to program</p>
    </aside>
  </section>

  <!--  -------------------------------------------------------------------------->
  <section data-transition="linear" data-transition-speed="medium">
    <p>The core belief is that the best way to build user interfaces is by using declarative programming</p>

    <p>In this approach,
      designers would be able to declare the behavior or components without knowing how the underlying behaviors were
      implemented</p>
    <aside class="notes">
      <p>The basic premise is a powerful one: Allow designers to sketch using HTML, then allow developers to build
        components and behaviors.</p>

      <p>Rinse and repeat</p>

      <p>The more components and behaviors that developers build the more powerfully, designers can sketch and
        iterate.</p>

  <section data-transition="linear" data-transition-speed="medium">
    <h2>What can Angular do for you?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Make it easier for you to reason about and build your web application - regardless of its size and

      <li>Applications which embrace Angular's features are inherently more testable</li>

  <p>Before we dig too deeply into code lets examine a few core concepts...</p>
  <aside class="notes">
    <p>Here is a basic HTML file that uses angular. We'll use this structure through this presentation. At the top of
      the file we see an ng-app attribute. This is simply a data tag which tells which part of the DOM to manage.</p>

    <p>Within the bottom of the body tag we see that angular is loaded along with our app.js script.</p>

    <p>This is all that is required to begin using AngularJS.</p>

    <p>Before we dig too deeply into code lets examine a few core concepts and key features.</p>

    <p>I promise we'll be back in code shortly.</p>
  </aside>
</section>

<!-- Core Concepts and Features -------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<section data-transition="linear" data-transition-speed="medium">
<section data-transition="linear" data-transition-speed="medium">
  <h2>Core Concepts and Features</h2>
  <aside class="notes">
    <p>The goal here is to get a sense of what's available and how we can take advantage of Angular in our own
      applications.</p>
  </aside>
</section>

<!-- Embracing best practices -------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<section data-transition="linear" data-transition-speed="medium">
  <h2>Embracing best practices</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Angular borrows heavily from other successful frameworks</li>
    <li>Angular implements popular idioms while embracing HTML and other web standards</li>
    <li>It's more about embracing HTML than wrestling with it</li>
  </ul>
  <aside class="notes">
    <p>Angular core developers would be the first to admit that Angular is based heavily on ideas which are far from
      new.</p>

    <p>After all, developers were using existing JavaScript frameworks long before Angular was introduced.</p>

    <p>What makes Angular interesting to developers is that it represents an evolution over older frameworks.</p>

    <p>One that embraces web standards and modern best practices.</p>
    <!--<p>Many envision a world where HTML and browser technologies evolve to a point where frameworks like Angular are far less neessary.</p>-->

  </aside>
</section>

<!-- It's all about the markup -------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<section data-transition="linear" data-transition-speed="medium">
  <h2>It's all about the markup</h2>

  <aside class="notes">
    <p>It's all about the markup. Well not actually.</p>

    <p>However, Angular treats HTML as a first class citizen rather than an ugly girlfriend.</p>

    <p>This focus on HTML is not misplaced as making HTML more useful and ultimately a pleasure to work is an
      important achievement</p>

    <p>Angular makes this possible by embracing declarative programming</p>
  </aside>

</section>

<!-- Declarative programming -------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<section data-transition="linear" data-transition-speed="medium">
  <h3>Declarative programming</h3>

  <p>Angular embraces HTML, by allowing designers and developers to describe what their HTML should do</p>

  <aside class="notes">
    <p>We touched on this idea earlier, where Angular was designed to enable designers to "declare" the behaviors
      associated with their markup.
    </p>

    <p>This declarative approach is different from the imperative approach we developers do when we write
      Python, Ruby or JavaScript code.</p>

    <p>With declarative programs we describe what programs should do and not how they're implemented.</p>

    <p>Angular embraces this approach allowing us to do this using directives and HTML behavioral annotations</p>

    <p>A core Angular philosophy is that the best way to build UI's is using declarative syntax. With Angular we add
      behavior to HTML markup using directives.</p>

    <p>Let's take a closer look at this directive stuff.</p>
  </aside>
</section>

<!-- HTML5 increasingly declarative -------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<section data-transition="linear" data-transition-speed="medium">
  <h3>HTML5: increasingly declarative</h3>
  <img style="border: 0; padding: 20px;" src="images/newhtml5tags.png">
  <aside class="notes">
    <p>HTML5 adds lots of new elements to HTML:</p>

    <p>This helps relieve the pressure of overloading div elements in ways that makes HTML less
      readable.</p>

    <p>The new HTML elements are great. But what if you wanted to create your own elements?</p>

    <p>Angular, extends HTML to allow you do just that.</p>
  </aside>
</section>

<!-- HTML5 data attribute -------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<section data-transition="linear" data-transition-speed="medium">
  <h3>HTML5 data attribute</h3>

  <p>The HTML5 data attribute allows designers to specify additional properties and behaviors for HTML5 elements.</p>

  <p>By querying the DOM, programmers can detect the presence of attributes to augment the element.</p>
  <aside class="notes">
    <p>Coupled with the new HTML5 elements, data attributes contributed to providing considerably more expressive
      power
      than was previously available.</p>

    <p>This was a really big step forward for HTML</p>

    <p>HTML5 data attributes allowed frameworks like jQueryMobile to simplify building mobile applications.</p>
  </aside>
</section>

<section data-transition="linear" data-transition-speed="medium">
  <p>In this example, jQueryMobile uses the <span class="pres-blue">data-role</span> and <span
    class="pres-blue">data-filter-placeholder</span>
    attributes to determine how the list
    should be transformed</p>
  <!--@formatter:off-->
    <pre><code>
  &lt;ul data-role=&quot;listview&quot; data-filter=&quot;true&quot;
         data-filter-placeholder=&quot;Search fruits...&quot;
         data-inset=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Banana&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Cherry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Cranberry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Grape&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Orange&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <!--@formatter:on-->
  <p>From the above to this...</p>
</section>

<section data-transition="linear" data-transition-speed="medium">
  <p>To this:</p>
  <img style="border: 0; padding: 20px;" src="images/Listview_-_jQuery_Mobile_Demos.png">
  <aside class="notes">
    <p>Beyond the mobile styling of what started off as simple markup, jQueryMobile has added behavior to mimic a
      popular component that allows for data navigation on mobile devices.</p>

    <p>The rows highlight as the user moves up and down the list, and the button on the right cause the panel to side
      to the left revealing a detail panel.</p>

    <p>The search field at the top of the control allows for filtering of the list in realtime.</p>

    <p>Angular fully embraces this paradigm by allowing developers to build their own component using directives.</p>
  </aside>
</section>

<section data-transition="linear" data-transition-speed="medium">
  <p>Angular calls these directives</p>

  <p>Earlier, we saw examples of directives when we looked at HTML for our basic angular app</p>
  <!--@formatter:off-->
    <pre><code contenteditable style="font-size: 18px; margin-top: 20px;">
  &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
  &lt;html ng-app&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Basic Angular App&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;script src=&quot;angular.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script src=&quot;app.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
  &lt;/html&gt;
    </code></pre>
    <!--@formatter:on-->
  <p>The <span class="pres-blue">ng-app</span> in the markup is an Angular directives used to inform Angular where the
    Angular application begins</p>
  <hr>
  <small class="pre-bold pres-light-yellow-highlight">Source: /samplecode/BasicAngularApp</small>
  <aside class="notes">
    <p>When the Angular script loads it scans the DOM looking for the ng-app directive. Angular then restricts its
      operations to just the scope of the ng-app directive.</p>

    <p>You can decorate a single div with the ng-app directive and only use Angular features within that div.</p>

    <p>You can even create your own directives. We'll revisit this topic a bit later.</p>
  </aside>
</section>

<!-- Extending HTML -------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<section data-transition="linear" data-transition-speed="medium">
  <h2>Extending HTML</h2>

  <aside class="notes">
    <p>The declarative nature of HTML and the ability to extend it using directives is fundamental to what Angular
      tries to help designers and developers achieve</p>

    <p>Many of Angular's features are designed first and foremost to support this goal and secondarily to provide the
      tools required to build non-trivial web applications.</p>

    <p>One way in which Angular does this is with a concept called data binding.</p>
  </aside>
</section>

<!-- Other important features include -------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<section data-transition="linear" data-transition-speed="medium">
  <h2>Other important features include</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Data Binding: Bidirectional sync between model and views</li>
    <li>Scope: A shared context used to store data, models</li>
    <li>Modules: A container for organizing your code</li>
    <li>Controllers: The C in MVC, business logic behind views</li>
    <li>Dependency Injection: Just in time access to code</li>
    <li>Providers: Factories and Service which are dependency injectable</li>
    <li>Support for testing: Both BDD unit tests and End-to-End</li>
    <li>And more...</li>
  </ul>
  <aside class="notes">
    <p>Angular's ability to extend HTML using a declarative approach is what distinguishes Angular from other JavaScript
      frameworks.</p>

    <p>And if that's all Angular offered it would still be a very useful tool.</p>

    <p>However, Angular doesn't stop there. In fact, it goes far beyond that with a suite of tools to address building
      modern, complex and production ready applications.</p>

    <p>Data Binding: This is angular's secret sauce for seamlessly syncing data between models and views.</p>

    <p>Scope: The Scope in Angular is a shared context used to store model data. The cool thing about the scope is that
      it can be shared. Furthermore, expressions in views can access scope data.</p>

    <p>Modules are a specialized container for organizing your code. You can add things like controllers, directives,
      and services.</p>

    <p>Controllers: The C in MVC, this is the main place you store your application specific business logic used to
      power views.</p>

    <p>Dependency Injection: Angular features a dependency injection system that allows you to create and register
      injectable modules which can be made available to other parts of your application.</p>

    <p>Providers: Angular implements a concept called a provider which can be used alone, or to build Factories and
      Services which are dependency injectable.</p>

    <p>Support for testing: Angular includes support for both unit testing and End-to-End testing. The tools described
      above aid in making your applications more testable by supporting
      separation of concerns.</p>

    <p>And there's more. However, with Angular you can use as little or as much as you need.</p>

    <p>We'll review each of these features later in this presentation.</p>
  </aside>
</section>


<!-- Angular MVC -------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<section data-transition="linear" data-transition-speed="medium">
  <h2>Pulling it altogether: Angular MVC</h2>

  <p>Angular support application separation of concerns using MVC and modules such as services and routers</p>
  <ul>
    <li>M: Model is implemented using the Scope</li>
    <li>V: Views are real HTML based templates</li>
    <li>C: Controllers are Constructor functions with access to Model data</li>
  </ul>
  <aside class="notes">
    <p>In Angular, the Model is implemented using the Scope</p>

    <p>The Scope, as we touched on previously is a context for storing data.</p>

    <p>Views are simply HTML templates with declarative annotation and data interpolations. I stress the word "REAL"
      here because other JavaScript functions handle HTML templates as string rather than real DOM elements. This is one
      of the features which make using Angular more natural than other frameworks.</p>

    <p>And lastly, Controllers. Controllers are just plain old JavaScript objects, created using a contructor function.
      Angular passes the associated Scope to your contructor function along with any other modules you need via
      dependency injection.</p>

    <p>An important concept here is that while you can use as little or as much of Angular as you need, each feature is
      designed to work together to help you tackle even the most challenging projects.</p>

<!-- Two important Angular conventions -------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<section data-transition="linear" data-transition-speed="medium">
  <h2>Important Angular conventions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Angular uses the <span class="pres-bold pres-red">ng-</span> prefix as a namespace</li>
    <li>It also prefixes the <span class="pres-bold pres-red">$</span> symbol in front of its providers, modules and
      services
    </li>
    <li>Best to avoid using those in your own code</li>
  </ul>
  <aside class="notes">
    <p>As we prepare to explore Angular code keep in mind that Angular prefixes its directives with the an NG
      prefix.</p>

    <p>People often ask why the ng prefix? The reason is because NG sounds more like Angular than AN or AG.</p>

    <p>Also, and this is somewhat unfortunate for jQuery developers, Angular prefixes many of its services with a dollar
      symbol.</p>

    <p>If I had to guess, and this may be a real strength... the $ symbol could stand for the S in service.</p>

    <p>It should go without saying that you shouldn't use these in your own code.</p>

    <p>Angular provides Modules as a place to group functionality whereby allowing you to organize your code
      while abiding by best practices such as not polluting the global namespace</p>

    <p>In the first listing above we see that we have now specified a name value to ng-app.
      This let's angular know that we have an Angular application module called myApp</p>

    <p>In our app.js file we simply call the module function on the Angular object passing it the name of our module and
      an empty array.</p>

    <p>The empty array is a placeholder to specify any dependencies our module might have.</p>

    <p>An important takeaway here is that there is global angular object which was introduced when we loaded angular on
      our HTML page using the script element.</p>

    <p>When angular loaded it looked for the ng-app data attribute (aka directive) and found that we provided a named
      application module called myApp.</p>

    <p>Another organizational feature angular provides is controllers.</p>

    <p>In controllers we can implement our applications business logic and is the C in Model View Controller
      paradigm.</p>

    <p>We specify controllers in our HTML markup using the Angular ng-controller directive.</p>

    <p>In our example here we've added the ng-controller directive to a div element.</p>

    <p>This means that the controller named myFirstController will operate on the div element and anything inside of
      it.</p>

    <p>We say that the myFirstController is scoped around or to the div element.</p>

    <p>Angular actually creates a new scope for our controller to use.</p>

    <p>Notice that we have a data bound expression (there's that curly mustache again) around data.message.</p>

    <p>We defined data.message in our controller using the code shown in the second code listing.</p>

    <p>There we've simply called the angular object's controller function to define our new controller.</p>

    <p>The second parameter to controller is an anonymous function which includes a $scope parameter.</p>

    <p>Angular is responsible for invoking our anonymous function and passing a new scope to our controller.</p>

    <p>From that point on we're able to attach data and functions to our scope object for use in data binding and
      other operations.</p>

    <p>You see how I've chained the controller call to the result of the module call above.</p>

    <p>As you can see, Angular object functions are chainable. But why did I do this?</p>

    <p>Because scopes are essentially JavaScript objects they can be inherited.</p>

    <p>At the top, we see the output from our three controllers</p>

    <p>Each tries to display the data.message(x) value from its accessible scope.</p>

    <p>The goal is to determine what scope data each controller has access to.</p>

    <p>The first controller has access to its own message but can't see the message of it's nested (child) controller,
      nor the value of the third and sibling controller.</p>

    <p>The second controller which is nested inside of the first controller, inherits visibility to it's parent's
      (outter) controller message and as expected has access to its own message.</p>

    <p>The third controller is outside of both the first and second controller and thus only see's its own scope
      message.</p>

    <p>The Angular Batarang plugin shows how the scopes are setup and visually confirms the nesting relationships</p>

  <h4>Controllers and methods</h4>

  <h2>!Function.prototype</h2>

  <aside class="notes">
    <p>The last controller topic we'll examine concerns methods and scopes</p>

    <p>We learned that an Angular Controller is a JavaScript constructor function.</p>

    <p>So you might expect to use prototypical inheritance to setup member functions.</p>

    <p>However that's not really the Angular way.</p>

    <p>In Angular, controllers are used to setup the initial state of a scope and to add behaviors to the scope.</p>

    <p>This is especially useful as it means that methods can be made accessible to directives and other controllers
      which might have visibility into the scope.</p>

    <p>When you need to create lots of functions to organize your code, you should do so in a provider, service, or
      factory.</p>

    <p>That will help avoid creating monolithic controllers which simply attach lots of functions to a scope.</p>

  <aside class="notes">
    <p>Dependency Injection is a design pattern that describes how a components can receive their dependencies</p>

    <p>This prevents needing complex component loaders and methods of resolving circular dependencies.</p>

    <p>The gist of this is that a dependency injection system provides methods for registering components and then
      passes those components where they are required.</p>

    <p>A benefit of this is that components don't have to manage locating other components - they're simply available
      when needed.</p>

    <p>Lets have a closer look at this. Earlier we saw how we create our Angular application module using the following
      code.</p>

    <p>The empty array on the right meant that we were not requiring any dependencies for our app.</p>

    <p>However, lets say that we wanted to take advantage of Angular's view routing
      mechanism.</p>

    <p>All we need to do is specify ngRoute in our array of dependencies.</p>

    <p>Then we'll write code which uses the ngRoute dependency and configure our application's routes.</p>

    <p>You can see here that the first parameter to the application config function is $routeProvider.</p>

    <p>Angular takes care of ensuring that it passes an ngRoute provider to the anonymous function.</p>

    <p>We simply use it without having to load it ourselves.</p>

    <p>We'll continue discussing dependency injection in the next section on Angular Providers.</p>

      <p>Angular has a concept called providers which is used to implement factories and services.</p>

      <p>This allows you to build reusable library-like components with their own function API.</p>

      <p>They help promote cleaner and better structured code which is both maintainable and testable.</p>

      <p>Much of the functionality that Angular offers comes to us via providers.</p>

      <p>We're encouraged to not only leverage the existing providers, but also to create our own.</p>
      <p>Part of the power behind Providers is that they automatically link to the dependency injection system making it easy for you to use your providers, services and factories.</p>

      <p>The JavaScript portion is much more interesting.</p>
      <p>Here we define our controller.  The big difference here is that we pass FirstService and FirstFactory string into our controller definition.</p>
      <p>This is dependency injection at work. Angular looks for providers which we've defined by those names.</p>
      <p>Just below our controller we see a service definition. Noticed that it isn't very different from controllers we've created.</p>
      <p>Our FirstService returns an object which has a getUser member. Services are essentially singltons which return data which they create or already hav access to.</p>
      <p>The object services return is created once and return however many times it's called.</p>
      <p>Keep in mind that this doesn't mean services return the same data when its functions are called... only that the object they return is created once.</p>
      <p>Factories are different in that Angular creates a new object to return each time. If invoked twice, each object returned will be a new instance.</p>

      <p>Ok, so we start with our controller. Notice that we're passing a string named StartDate</p>

      <p>That's the name of our provider.</p>

      <p>Within our controller we assign the value of calling the start date provider's getStartDate member to the startDate data item on the current scope</p>
      <p>Next we define our StartDate provider</p>

      <p>Now this is different from how services and factories are setup.  We assign an anonymous function to a $get object member.</p>
      <p>Like a factory the code assigns a function which returns a function.  This allows for data members which are not visible outside this clousure.</p>
      <p>When a provider is injected into a controller Angular actually returns the $get function directly.</p>

  <!-- Why is it called Angular? -------------------------------------------------------------------------->
  <section data-transition="linear" data-transition-speed="medium">
    <h3>Why is it called Angular?</h3>

    <p>Named after the HTML angled bracket</p>
    <aside class="notes">
      <p>People often ask why the name Angular? AngularJS focuses on HTML markup which contains angled brackets</p>

      <p>So Angular was named after the HTML angled brackets</p>

  <!-- Why is the logo a shield with a letter A on it? -------------------------------------------------------------------------->
  <section data-transition="linear" data-transition-speed="medium">
    <h3>Why is the logo a shield with a letter "A" on it?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Logo chosen because the shield resembles the HTML5</li>
      <li>Misko felt that the shield represents Angular shielding developers from the low-level
        differences among web browsers
      </li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="notes">
      <p>The logo was chosen because the shield resembles the HTML5 logo which also uses a shield and Angular runs on
        top of HTML5
      </p>

      <p>Also Misko liked the logo because the shield represents Angular shielding developers from the low-level
        differences among web browsers
