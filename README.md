# AngularJS Presentation

This is Yet Another AngularJS Presentation. I set out to create a simple presentation for my team mates at EstateAssist. A week later I was still deep down the rabbit hole. Angular isn't an easy framework to cover and it's difficult to do it justice with a quick presentation.

I played around with RevealJS a while back and felt it would be a perfect platform to for a presentation on Angular. Since the entire presentation runs in a web browser, I decided the presentation should include live Angular code. Heck, why not right?

The resulting presention doesn't cover all of Angular. In fact, I specifically left out a great deal in order to make the presentation mentally digestable.
